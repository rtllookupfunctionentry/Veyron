/* Henge's Mach-O loader for the Mac-app translation layer: loads an arm64
   macOS executable and the frameworks inside its bundle without dyld, binds
   their imports to the host's own libraries (iOS's, or a shim), registers
   them with the Objective-C and Swift runtimes, and runs them in-process.

   Why not dyld: on a TXM device (every device iOS 27 supports) an app cannot
   make new pages executable; Henge gets one executable region per launch
   from a debugger. Code goes into that region, written through its writable
   alias; every other segment is ordinary memory placed at the same distance
   from the code as in the file, so PC-relative references still land. */
